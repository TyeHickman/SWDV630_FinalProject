## SWDV 630 Week 8 - Final Project

---

For my final, I have created an approximation of a simple Pizza Ordering system similar to what you would find at Domino's.

To run the project, simply run the `DriverApplication.py` file. I have created test methods in the classes that will auto-populate data to exercise the classes.
